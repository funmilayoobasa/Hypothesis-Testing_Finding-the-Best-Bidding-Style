# Hypothesis-Testing_Finding-the-Best-Bidding-Style
I analysed the A/B test data of a hypothetical company to determine the best bidding type for selling a product. I found the data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilkeryildiz/example-dataset-for-ab-test) and felt it would be great for practice.
#### Method

I conducted a hypothesis test to determine which bidding type would increase conversions, in this case, the number of purchases.

I asked: 

**Which bidding type leads to more purchases?**

My hypotheses were: 

* **Null hypothesis**: There is no difference between the mean purchases of the control group and the test group.
* **Alternative hypothesis**: There is a difference between the mean purchases of the control group and the test group. 

Alpha = 0.05 (5%).
